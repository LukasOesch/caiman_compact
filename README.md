# caiman_compact
Script to run caiman analysis pipeline from the command line.
Before running this script make sure to properly install caiman in its environment.

To run the analysis launch an anaconda prompt (or git bash if configured accordingly)
inside this repo. Activate the caiman environment and then run the following:

python -W ignore caiman_compact.py

-> the -W ignore statement helps to suppress depreciation warnings.
